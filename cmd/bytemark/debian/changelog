bytemark-client (0.4.253-1) stable; urgency=low

    New features:
    * `show account` now shows owner & tech contact details
    * last debug.log is kept as debug.log.1

    Changes:
    * `create vm`, `show vm`, `list vms` now use 'server' in place of 'vm'

    Fixes:
    * `config set` now checks whether the var you're setting is real.
    * power commands output correct help info
    * power commands check for too many arguments
    * `create server` now takes arguments after the name, bringing it in line
      with the help.
