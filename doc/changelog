bytemark-client (2.5.1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  Added tools/LICENSE.txt and tools/VERIFICATION.txt to the Chocolatey
  package. This update only affects windows, and is necessary because
  Chocolatey's automated validation now requires them, and bytemark-client 2.5
  was not published as a result

 -- telyn <telyn@bytemark.co.uk>  Wed, 20 Sep 2017 14:25:41 +0100

bytemark-client (2.5) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  Changes:
  * Fix SIGSEGV when launching a browser (bytemark console --panel)
  * Remove duplicate notice that a browser is going to be launched
  * A backup schedule is now added to a server's first disc by default, set
    --backup-schedules to 'none' to disable it.

  Admin-only changes:
  * Improve output for show migrating_discs, show head, show heads
  * Add MigrationProgress, MigrationEta and MigrationSpeed fields on discs


 -- telyn <telyn@bytemark.co.uk>  Mon, 18 Sep 2017 21:26:37 +0100

bytemark-client (2.4) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  ### New features

  * Support for backups via the `create backup`, `delete backup`, `schedule
    backups`, `unschedule backups`, `show disc` and `list backups` commands.
  * Support for longer session validities than the old default of 5 minutes.
    Use the --session-validity global flag & config variable to set your
    session validity. Otherwise, it will default to the new default of 30
    minutes.

 -- telyn <telyn@bytemark.co.uk>  Fri, 27 Jun 2017 16:56:28 +0100

bytemark-client (2.3) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  ### New features

  * Logging in with 2-factor authentication is now supported, but setting up
    2-factor auth is not yet ready.
  * Added a new table output format using `--table` and `--table-fields` to
    most commands which support `--json` output. `--table` and `--json` are
    now aliases for the global flag `--output-format <json | table>` - which
    can also be specified using `config set output-format`. The default
    output format for most commands is 'human' - which behaves the same as
    previous versions, but is 'table' for admin-only commands.
    Table output is not intended to be machine readable and the list of
    fields displayed by default for any given command may change between
    releases of bytemark-client. Use the 'json' `--output-format` or the
    `list` commands for any scripting.
    Specify `--table-fields help` to see the available fields for a command
    There is an additional output-format called 'debug' which outputs the
    object as go code.
  * Added the `commands` command, which displays a list of all the commands
    available in bytemark-client.
  * `show server` will now accept a server's ID instead of a name.
  * `images`, `zones`, `storage` and `hwprofiles` commands can now be output
    as JSON or tables using the `--output-format`, `--json`, or `--table`
    flags.

  ### Changes / Fixes

  * specifying --yubikey will now prompt you to login again if your current
    auth token was not created using a yubikey
  * some commands were not correctly setting a default account, forcing the
    end user to specify their server in server.group.account form, or their
    group in group.account form. This has now been fixed and should be
    consistent across all commands.
  * the --group global flag / config var was being ignored. Now it gets
    used.
  * 401 Unauthorized errors are now handled gracefully. These errors occur
    when your authentication token is invalid or unset, whereas 403
    Forbidden errors occur when your token is valid but you do not have
    permission to access something.
  * Brain accounts without a matching billing account now show their VMs
    under show account / list servers.
  * `resize disk` now works again

  ### New admin commands

  * approve server
  * cancel migration disc
  * cancel migration server
  * create ip_range
  * create user
  * create vlan_group

  * empty head

  * empty tail
  * reap vm
  * regrade disc
  * reify discs
  * reject server
  * update head
  * update migration
  * update storage_pool
  * update tail

  ### Admin-only changes

    * show ip_range now accepts CIDR representation as well as ID
    * account name defaulting behaviour on Bytemark internal/staging brains
      is now better
    * show head[s] now correctly display whether the heads are online

  * Added list of admin-only commands to 'bytemark help admin'

  ### Changes

    user-friendly
  * Debug output (written to debug.log) now has a header containing useful info
    (client version, exact invocation)
  * Almost all arguments are now specifiable as flags
  * Signup form now maxes out at 120 characters wide
  * overview command now has a limit on how many servers per group it will
    show

  ### Fixes

    be well and truly squashed now
  * Fixed formatting on the USAGE section of help formatting
  * Certain error messages from the API are now dealt with better
  * HTTP 500 (Internal Server Errors) are handled much better now
  * Some error messages that were output twice are now only output once

bytemark-client (2.1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  ### New features

  * `bytemark set cdrom` has been added to set the URL of an ISO for a server.
  * bytemark config set now validates values - account name typos should be
    a thing of the past :-)

  ### Changes

  * RPM packages are now signed
  * man page has been made nicer.
  * man page is the same on macOS as Linux now.
  * Disc labels are now generated as 'disc-N', where N is the index of the
    disc or one larger than the largest other disc with a 'disc-N' label,
    whichever is larger. This matches the panel's behaviour.
  * The --no-discs flag on create server has been removed due to the endpoint
    no longer supporting it.
  * The list of images in `bytemark images` and `bytemark storage grades` are
    now sorted.

  ### Fixes

    error

  * -v | --version now shows the current version instead of producing an error
  * RPM package now contains the man page, instead of 2 copies of the client
    itself.

    login details

    client . Admin commands can only be used by cluster admins.
  * admin command: show heads. this is only an initial version and will
    change over time.

  ### Changes

  * Input errors (not enough arguments, too many arguments, incorrect flags)
    now output only one error and don't show the help for that command,
    instead suggesting you look at the help for that command.
  * add key now errors when no key is entered.
  * Improve algorithm for figuring out which account is default, and make
    list commands use the same algorithm as other commands.
  * Reordered address fields in the signup form

bytemark-client (1.1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  Prevent the following from being output to the log file during account
  creation:
    * card reference
    * user password

  Also prevent card references from being output to the log file whenever
  account information is downloaded, and root passwords for servers being
  output to the log file during reimaging and server creation.
  Passwords during the authentication step have never been logged.

  Temporarily this means that less debugging information is available.
  A better, more precise fix for this secrets-leaking will be available in
  either version 2.0 or 2.1.

  No new features or other changes in this release.
