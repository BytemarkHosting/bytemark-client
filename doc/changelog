bytemark-client (1.1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  Prevent the following from being output to the log file during account
  creation:
  * card reference
  * user password

  Also prevent card references from being output to the log file whenever
  account information is downloaded, and root passwords for servers being
  output to the log file during reimaging and server creation.
  Passwords during the authentication step have never been logged.

  Temporarily this means that less debugging information is available.
  A better, more precise fix for this secrets-leaking will be available in
  either version 2.0 or 2.1.

  No new features or other changes in this release.
